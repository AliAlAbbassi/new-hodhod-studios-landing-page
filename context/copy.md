I love seeing the new revenue right in WiseShopping 
The hodhod setup was easy, and I appreciate you helping me ensure it's working properly. I also really like how I can see the new revenue reflected in Wiseshopping.

We saw a total business revenue increase of 16.08% in one month
After adding HODHOD to our site, we saw a total business revenue increase of 19.02% in one month, which translated to an extra $2623 in revenue directly from HODHOD. You guys freaking ROCK!

Over the last 2 months, Hyros AIR generated $17,287.80 in revenue for us — on autopilot.

That’s a 5045% increase from our baseline. And that’s just from leads AIR identified, nurtured, and converted without us lifting a finger. AIR is next-level. It tracks website behavior in real time, identifies hot leads, and then sends AI-written, personalized emails based on what they’re browsing — all while we're focused on running the business.

In addition to revenue, we saw:

* 16 new sales (up 1500%)
* 43 qualified calls booked (up 4200%)
* 2700+ intent-based emails sent
* 2761 new leads reactivated

The best part? These were leads we would’ve otherwise lost. Hyros AIR turned them into revenue — automatically. If you’re serious about growth, Hyros AIR isn’t a nice-to-have — it’s essential. We highly recommend it to any business that runs funnels, has traffic, and wants to finally monetize their invisible leads.
