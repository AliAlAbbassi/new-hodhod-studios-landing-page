create a landing page for the Hodhod Studios agency 

Hodhod is a linkedin automation engine powered by AI agents, a saas company for b2b sellers. 

It's an AI remarketing agent, that tracks engagements from linkedin page/account egagement to website visitors to user imported leads and do this process below. 

Hodhod AI automatically qualifies every lead for ICP fit, conducts deep research, crafts hyper-personalized messages that sound just like you, and automates it on LinkedIn while keeping your account safe.

Hodhod studios is going to be the service version of the hodhod saas. 
this landing page is for hodhod studios, the service based business of it


tech stack:
- bun
- nextjs
- typescript
- shadcn
- tailwindcss
- use whatever cool libraries you can
- use a 3d model with threejs in the hero

the landing page should have the following sections:
- hero
- about
- services
- contact
- footer

feel free to copy some of this 
https://www.emerge.haus/

it should look outraguously good and advanced, and it should be responsive

give it a the lovable look, where it has this white noise with distortion and very minimalistic

the theme should be white with a dotted background, ok to use gradients with these colors

"""
        vec3 colTop = vec3(1.0, 0.6, 0.1); // Bright Orange
        vec3 colBot = vec3(1.0, 0.1, 0.4); // Bright Red/Pink
        vec3 fillCol = mix(colBot, colTop, uv.y + 0.5);
"""

now idk how these colors are denoted, but you could probably figure it out. Might be rgb or rgba or something else. 

use this svg as the logo at /Users/cuthlehoop/projects/hodhod-studios-new-landing-page/hoopoe-bright.svg

or hoopoe-bright.svg
